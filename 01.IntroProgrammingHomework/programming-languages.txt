1. Java

Java is an object-oriented programming language, similar to C#. Java applications are most commonly compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The main phylosophy of the Java programming language is "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another.

2. PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language and can be embedded into HTML. Has had consistent syntax issues throughout the years, expected to be resolved with the release of PHP 7.0 in mid October 2015.

3.Java Script

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers. Despite some naming, syntactic, and standard library similarities, JavaScript and Java are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The syntax of JavaScript is actually derived from C, while the semantics and design are influenced by Self and Scheme programming languages.

4.Python

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles.

5.Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. Matsumoto has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good user interface design.
